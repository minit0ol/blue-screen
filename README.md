you’re busy on the computer, working away unsuspectedly, and suddenly the entirely display disappears. For a short time, you see a blue screen with some information pop up. Before you can read everything, the PC shuts off and restarts itself. The Windows “blue screen of death” (BSOD), also known as a “STOP error” or “Bug Check”, is an infamous warning message about corrupt hardware, software, or drivers that force Windows to shut down. The blue screen is evidence of a critical system error. As a protective measure, the computer shuts down - causing you as the user to initially just stare at your screen in confusion or annoyance. Depending on your Windows version, the blue screen can look different.

## How to fix blue screen error during upgrade on Windows 10

When you upgrade to a new version of Windows 10, a blue screen error may appear for many reasons. For example, it could result from a compatibility problem with an old program or security software. Or it could be because of corrupted files in the current installation or damaged installation media.

Typically, when an error occurs, the setup will revert the changes to the previous installation without an explanation.

If you are dealing with errors during the installation, uninstalling non-essential apps, clearing out corrupt downloads, disconnecting non-essential peripherals, or doing a clean install of Windows 10 may resolve the issue.
